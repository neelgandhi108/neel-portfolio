The success of improving healthcare services is largely due to the amount of patients data acquired usually in privacy-invasive ways for the process of machine learning. The issue of privacy-preserving and utilizing the large and diverse private datasets is solved using federated learning. It can perform predictive tasks alongside maintaining privacy of medical data. In this paper, we have proposed cancer text classification system using federated learning to maintain the integrity of sensitive medical data. The acquisition of data from various healthcare institutions is used for detection of cancer in preliminary stage in the patient\'s body. The experiment has been conducted for various types of healthcare environmental settings for the process of federated learning including change in the number of health institutions involved, change in data distribution among numerous healthcare institutions involved, and performance in case of applying various machine learning models. Here, we utilize several machine learning models namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Bi-RNN, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long short-term Memory (LSTM) for text classification that attains accuracy of 57%, 59%, 60%, and 61% respectively.

CVDs can be prevented by diagnosing heartbeat sounds and other conventional techniques early to reduce the harmful effects caused by CVDs. However, it is still challenging to segment, extract features, and predict heartbeat sounds in elderly people. The inception of deep learning (DL) algorithms has helped detect various types of heartbeat sounds at an early stage. Motivated by this, we proposed an intelligent architecture categorizing heartbeat into normal and murmurs for elderly people. We have used a standard heartbeat dataset with heartbeat class labels, i.e., normal and murmur. Furthermore, it is augmented and preprocessed by normalization and standardization to significantly reduce computational power and time. The proposed convolutional neural network and bi-directional gated recurrent unit (CNN + BiGRU) attention-based architecture for the classification of heartbeat sound achieves an accuracy of 90% compared to the baseline approaches. Hence, the proposed novel CNN + BiGRU attention-based architecture is superior to other DL models for heartbeat sound classification."},{"title":"Stacked Ensemble Learning Based Approach for Anomaly Detection in IoT Environment.","organization":"IEEE International Conference on Range Technology (ICORT)","paperUrl":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9581549","description":"Machine learning based anomaly detection systems have gained prominence in field of Internet of Things (IoT) due to their effectiveness in dealing with security and privacy issues.

In recent years, researchers have been working on replacing classical machine learning models with quantum machine learning models using quantum circuits. Also, the mathematical structure of quantum model has close correlation with kernel-based methods like support vector machine, where data has been analyzed using high dimensional Hilbert spaces calculated by inner products through measurement. The bridge between kernels and quantum machine learning models is solved with the use of classical kernel applied on quantum device. The approach is found to be suitable for providing improvised or comparable results with respect to classical machine learning models. In the given work, we have compared quantum models based on kernel-based training against variational training based models specifically in terms of number of circuits. It can be noted that kernel-based training performs training with relatively less number of quantum circuit evaluations as compared to variational training. Also, considering each evaluation circuit is much shorter in case of kernel-based training rather than variational circuit training. The efficiency of kernel-based and variational-based circuits usually depends upon the number of parameters used for developing the variational quantum model. In the current scenario, kernel-based method could be a better alternative compared to variational circuit due to their hardware capability requiring less number of parameters equivalent to the order of the training set size. The proposed kernel-based training might be useful for fault-tolerant and near-term quantum models, where kernel is helpful for computing the distances between the data encoding of the quantum states. At last, kernel-based approach for quantum machine learning could be helpful in encoding the data for corresponding quantum states that can potentially be effective rather than classical machine learning models in terms of performance, time, and efficiency."},{"title":"sEMG Assisted Hand Gesture Recognition using Bi-Directional LSTM and Uni-Directional LSTM","organization":"Springer International Conference on Frontiers of Intelligent Computing: Theory and Applications","paperUrl":"","description":"In Publication"}]'),c="Publications_container__-Vyk8",l=i(184),d=function(){return(0,l.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,l.jsx)(r.h4,{title:"Publications"}),(0,l.jsx)(t.Z,{fluid:!0,className:c,children:(0,l.jsx)(o.Z,{style:{display:"flex",justifyContent:"center",alignItems:"center"},children:s.map((function(e,a){return(0,l.jsx)(r.oT,{title:e.title,organization:e.organization,description:e.description,paperUrl:e.paperUrl},a)}))})})]})}}}]);
