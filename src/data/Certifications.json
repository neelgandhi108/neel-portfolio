            "The program taught about how to become a better Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning Engineer by teaching classical AI algorithms applied to common problem types. I completed projects and exercises incorporating search, optimization, planning, and probabilistic graphical models which have been used in Artificial Intelligence applications for automation, logistics, operations research, and more. The concepts form the foundation for many of the most exciting advances in AI in recent years."

            "AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. In this Specialization, I gained practical experience applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine. I learnt how to: Diagnose diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images Predict patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models Estimate treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials Automate the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing."

This program will prepared me for a specific career or role, rather, it will grew my deep learning and reinforcement learning expertise, and nurture the skills I need to understand the most recent advancements in deep reinforcement learning, and build and implement my own algorithms. The term is comprised of 4 courses and 3 projects, which are described in detail below. Building a project is one of the best ways to demonstrate the skills I learned, and each project will contribute to an an impressive professional portfolio that shows potential employers my mastery of reinforcement learning and deep learning techniques"

            "Nanodegree helped me learn to detect obstacles in lidar point clouds through clustering and segmentation, apply thresholds and filters to radar data in order to accurately track objects, and augment your perception by projecting camera images into three dimensions and fusing these projections with other sensor data. Combine this sensor data with Kalman filters to perceive the world around a vehicle and track objects over time."
